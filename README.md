The price is rigth 

I made a "Juste prix game" without any price or anything, just a guessing number. The goal was to practice JS and the DOM section of the odin project.

I've learned about setInterval and clearInterval function which i used to build the timer.  The timer did cause me trouble as i initially wanted to use Time objects to build. Also the fact that i couldn't use any while loop or prompt because it caused the timer to stop working was a little difficult. I had to change the prompt function with and input element. 
Also, organizing the different function of my code and making them work wasn't working so i had to reshape the game function and kinda suff everything inside it.

The program seemed to work until i discovered it worked only for one round. 
Bugs :  - the hint panel print more when it should print less
        - the chrono also inscrease for no reason sometimes
